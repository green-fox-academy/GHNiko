            <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, 
                it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
            <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, 
                so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. 
                It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of 
                data inside the memory.</p>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. 
                They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
            <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. 
                It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
            <p>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web.
